# Shoppping cart with discount exercise with Elixir

This is a programming exercise that creates a simple shopping cart program.

The concept:

* A `JSon configuration file` containing all sold items -- i call it shop.
    --Provides item names and costs and offers

* A `Cart` holds a user's items.
    --Can be empty or contain list of items
      What is contained in the cart is the list of items code

* A `Till` calculates the cost of a cart's items.
   --Evaluates each item discount according to the rules in the json configuration file

* A `Checkout` program handles the input and output.
   --CMI- starts with inputs then cart creation then calculates the till then outputs the final cost
